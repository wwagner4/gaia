### Create an animated x3d model
From the data [x3d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X3D) xml files with animation can be created
### Create video snippets
From the x3d animated models high resolution videos can be created. They might be used for
creating videos. for exampes see [my video channel TODO](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4FUfmBs-A-m3iCHTP3tHVw)

## TODO
- No reaction by clicking on desc image/page
- Add new features to camera create (when needed in the subsequent points).
    - other ranges than 0 - 360, e.g. longer 0 - 400, shorter 0, 180
